      <div class="article-title"> BIM Dimension </div>
      <p class="article-lead">Here is below, a brief description of the current seven dimensions of BIM:   </p>
      <ol class="article-summary" type="I">
  <li>2nd dimension is considered the documentation,The two geometric dimensions XY. </li>
  <li>3rd dimension is considered the space,The three geometric dimensions XYZ Without them the BIM would not be, They allow visualization and representation. </li>
  <li>4th dimension is considered the time,Adds a "time" data to the three geometric dimensions it allows  visualize in time the duration of an event or the progress of a construction phase. </li>
  <li>5th dimension is considered a cost,Adds the "cost" data to the 4 previous dimensions it Allows to estimate the construction costs or get an overview of the financial situation of a project at a given moment. </li>
  <li>6th dimension is helps perform energy consumption analyses, It also allows for measurement and verification during building occupation, and improved processes for gathering lessons learned in high performance facilities. </li>
  <li>7th dimension the 7D model as constructed contains all the information necessary to the owner for the use and maintenance of the building. </li>

  <br> <p class="sub-title"> ICE BIM</p>
<p>According to the event website, ICE BIM 2016 (19th October 2016) will showcase best practice of Level 2, focusing on projects and case studies, combined with an in-depth guidance and analysis through dedicated workshops and panel discussions on implementing digital excellence.</p>
    <br> <p class="sub-title"> Digital Construction Week</p>
<p>The leading construction exhibition and conference focusing solely on digital technology and BIM.   Held annually the next event will take place on 26th-27th October 2016.</p>

  <br> <p class="sub-title">Annual BIM Conference</p>  
<p>According to the organiser’s website “delegates will learn about the arguments surrounding how widespread use of BIM can be encouraged in the construction industry, the effects of government initiatives on BIM uptake, advancements in BIM technology, and the environmental benefits of BIM adoption”.   The second edition of this event was held in July 2016 and the date for next year’s event is unavailable at the time of writing.

For further local and ad hoc events, the BIM hub maintains an excellent calendar of workshops, seminars and conferences.   Visit<a href="https://thebimhub.com/events"> here.</a>
